Decided to do an overhaul of the project due to performance issues, asthetic issues, and overall poor codebase organization.

This time around I will:
- use MatPlotLib's Animation methods to improve rendering time.
- Allow for the user to choose the websocket connection, csv parsing, or function input for data collection.
- Organize it in a more extendable and thoughtfull way.

Structure:
- main.py: runs the animation loop, importing data from external sources.
- websocket.py: Establishes connection with Vexcode Pro extension over websocket, defines an update method.
- csv.py: defines an update method.
- simulate.py: defines an update method.
